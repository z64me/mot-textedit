# mot-textedit

Ad hoc text editing solution for *The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time* written in one night. Meant to serve as a reference for [Patcher64](https://github.com/Admentus64/Patcher64Plus-Tool)'s builtin text editor.

I may revisit this if I ever get around to writing `z64locale`.

Feel free to adapt it for use with other projects. :)
